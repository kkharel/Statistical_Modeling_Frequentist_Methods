This comes from the Central Limit Theorem which states : When the sample size is large enough, the distribution of sample mean becomes approximately normal even if the raw data is not normally distributed. The raw data must be normal only when the sample size is small (n < 30)."

        "Hypothesis testing works the same in both study types. But the study design affects interpretation not the mechanics. In experiments, a significant result imples **causation** while in observational studies, a significant result imples only **association**. If the study is observational, we cannot claim causation even if the test is significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Observational study is a type of research where the investigator simply observes and records data without interfering or assigning treatments. The researcher does not control who receives what condition, they just study variables as they naturally occur. Because of this lack of control, observational studies can identify associations between variables but cannot establish causation, since confounding factors may influence the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, an experimental study involves deliberately manipulating one or more variables and assigning subjects to different groups, often using randomization. This controlled setup allows researchers to isolate the effect of the variable of interest, making it possible to draw stronger conclusions about **cause and effect**.\n",

        "1) **Confounding**: A third variable affects both variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Reverse causality**: Outcome might affect the “cause.”\n",

        "\n",
        "Why do we need these? If normality assumptions are violated or sample size is small, we can use non-parametric alternatives. Most common non-parametric tests are designed to test the median (or ranks) rather than the mean. Mean-Whitney U is sometimes described as testing \"difference in distributions\", not strictly median. But for many practical cases, if the shapes of the distributions are similar, a significant Mann-Whitney U result implies difference in medians.\n",
        "\n",
        "Medians are robust to outliers and skewed data. Ranks focus on order not exact values, which avoids relying on the assumption about the mean. For small or non-normal samples, this gives more reliable inerence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, non-paramteric tests are robut alternatives to t-tests and ANOVA when assumptions are violated."

        "We investigated how different marketing strategies (A, B, C) affect seller revenue using four methods: regression adjustment, propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and instrumental variables (IV). Using regression adjustment to control for experience and marketing budget, we found that Strategy B and C did not significantly increase the probability of achieving high revenue compared to Strategy A, highlighting that experience and budget are the strongest predictors. Propensity score matching revealed that, after balancing for observed covariates, Strategy A sellers earned on average 4.58 less than similar non-A sellers, and IPW produced a similar result, with Strategy A slightly underperforming other strategies by 1.63. However, when using IV analysis with region as an instrument to account for unobserved confounding, we found a strong positive causal effect: moving from one strategy to a higher-coded strategy (A to B to C) increased revenue by approximately 50.8 units. Overall, these results suggest that while observational adjustments indicate Strategy A is not particularly effective, accounting for hidden confounders reveals that upgrading to higher strategies can substantially increase revenue. Experience and marketing budget remain important, but causal analysis highlights the significant benefits of more advanced marketing strategies."

The Treat coefficient was not significant, indicating that the treated and control groups had similar revenue before the intervention, which supports the DiD assumption that they would have followed parallel trends in the absence of the strategy. The Post coefficient showed a general revenue increase of about 5.6 units over time for all sellers. Importantly, the DiD (interaction) coefficient was approximately 10 units and highly significant, meaning that treated sellers earned around 10 units more than controls due to the strategy. Overall, these results indicate that the marketing strategy had a positive causal effect on revenue, beyond general time trends"

The results show that Strategy B significantly increased revenue by about 5.35 units compared to Strategy A, while Strategy C showed a smaller, non-significant increase of 1.72 units. Experience had a strong positive effect, with each additional year increasing revenue by approximately 2.18 units. The model explains about 64% of the variation in revenue, indicating a good fit. Because the strategies were randomly assigned, the observed differences can be interpreted as causal effects, and adjusting for experience allows for a more precise estimate of the strategy effect.

        "In this experimental study, sellers were randomly assigned to marketing strategies (A, B, or C) across 20 regions, and revenue was analyzed using a mixed-effects model with Region as a random intercept. The model accounts for both fixed effects (Strategy and Experience) and random variation across regions, capturing baseline differences in revenue between regions. The results indicate that Strategy B increased revenue by an average of 4.82 units and Strategy C by 2.44 units, both statistically significant (p < 0.001) compared to Strategy A. Experience also had a strong positive effect, with revenue increasing by about 2 units per year of experience. The estimated variance of the random intercept for Region was 66.64, indicating meaningful variability in baseline revenue across regions. Overall, this mixed-effects approach appropriately models the nested structure of the data and provides robust estimates of strategy effects while accounting for regional differences"

        "Causal Mediation Analysis helps us understand not just whether a marketing strategy affects revenue, but how it does so. In many cases, the effect of a strategy may operate through intermediate variables—called mediators—rather than solely directly. In this study, we considered the seller's MarketingBudget as a potential mediator. Sellers with more experience tend to allocate higher budgets, which could amplify the impact of the chosen strategy on revenue.\n",

        "We first modeled how the strategy influences the marketing budget and then how both strategy and marketing budget affect revenue. By multiplying these effects, we estimated the indirect effect—the portion of the strategy's impact on revenue that occurs through changes in marketing budget. This allows us to distinguish the direct effect of the strategy (impact not explained by budget) from the indirect effect (impact transmitted via budget). For example, Strategy B increases revenue partly because it leads sellers to allocate more budget, illustrating the mechanism behind the observed revenue gains.\n",

The permutation p-value is the proportion of these permuted differences that are as extreme as or more extreme than the observed difference. A small p-value indicates that the observed difference is unlikely to arise by chance, providing strong evidence that the treatment (strategy) has a causal effect on revenue.\n",

If the treated group improves more than the control group over the same period, that extra improvement can be attributed to the treatment—assuming that without the intervention, the two groups would have followed similar trends.\n",

Instead of simply comparing before and after averages, ITS explicitly models the underlying trend leading up to the intervention and asks whether the event caused (1) an immediate jump in the outcome or (2) a change in the trajectory afterward. This makes ITS especially useful in marketing and policy settings where natural time trends like seasonal patterns or gradual growth must be accounted for.\n",

ITS solves this by modeling the pre-campaign trend and then checking whether the campaign caused a statistically detectable change in the level of revenue or its growth rate. If we see a sudden upward shift right after the intervention—beyond what the trend predicted that is strong evidence of a campaign effect."

Instead of relying on a traditional control group, SCM builds a “synthetic” version of the treated unit by combining multiple control units using optimized weights. The idea is that this synthetic control closely matches the treated unit's pre-intervention behavior, giving us a more credible counterfactual for what would have happened without the treatment.\n",
